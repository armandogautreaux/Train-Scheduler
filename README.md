Train-Scheduler

How it works? 
When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
Train Name
Destination 
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes
This app is coded to calculate when the next train will arrive; this is be relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines are be able to view same train times.
