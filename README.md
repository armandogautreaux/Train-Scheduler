Train-Scheduler

How it works? When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following: (i) Train Name, (ii) Destination, (iii) First Train Time -- in military time, (iv) Frequency -- in minutes. This app is coded to calculate when the next train will arrive; this is be relative to the current time. Users from many different machines are be able to view same train times.
